MangoDB is a database (no sql)
It uses collections and documents (keys and values)
documents -> individual records in a specific collection
  
Example:
{
title: "Name of the wind"
author:"patrick"
pages:600

}

Every document has specific unique ID value given by MangoDB itself
  example : _id: ObjectId('68f7a56c2abc3360554a8806')
